# Introduction Ideas

- The computing resources at DFCTI are running high-priority simulations that have a large amount of complexity, which can lead to crucial results to the scientific community that focus of research topics such as Solid State Physics, Laser Physics, Radiation Interaction with Matter, and much more.
- Assuring a fluent execution of all the processes that run on the computing resources within the department is a core objective for the system administration *sysadmin* team.
