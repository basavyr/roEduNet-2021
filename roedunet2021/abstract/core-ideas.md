## Title

A list of potential titles.

1. *Implementation of an alerting system via e-mail in a Physics Department*
2. *Development of an e-mail based alert system in a Physics Department*
3. *Preventing unusual behavior of the computing resources at DFCTI through an e-mail based alert system*
4. *Integration of an e-mail based alert system within the computing grid at DFCTI*
5. *Detecting, alerting and preventing unusual behavior within the computing resources at DFCTI*	

## Core ideas

Key aspects that the paper should focus on:

- Importance of any alert system that warns the user with regards to the unusual behavior of the computing resources.
- Relevance of the e-mail based alert system (e-mail is still being used, especially on the work-side paradigm). 
- Permanent analysis of the computing resources (i.e., their usage in terms of processing power, memory, storage, and so on) is crucial when complex simulations that require long execution time run on these systems.
- Alerting the system administrator with regards to potential issues in any of the underlying metrics can lead to optimal resource runtime.
- Using Python as main development programming language. This ensures that the alerting service has great compatibility across different systems.

## Abstract ideas

The computing resources at DFCTI need to be up and running at all times, assuring an uninterrupted pipeline for the queue of processes which need to be executed.

The large-scale simulations and calculations requested by the physicists within the department require great amount of compute power, and they also demand a high degree of scalability.

Assuring thus a great workflow must be a crucial objective. This can be expressed with the help of a monitoring team that always checks for potential issues with the computing resources (i.e., unusual behavior of the CPU's, failure of the memory, high disk usage).
